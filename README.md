# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion solution

This is a solution to the project FAQ accordion.
The project was developed through the challenge of the frontEnd mentor, so I looked for the best practices to execute this project.

## About the challenge

- With this project, users can hide/show the answer to a question when the wuestion is clicked.
- When clicking on the question it will show the answer to each question.
- When clicking on a question, the previous element will.
